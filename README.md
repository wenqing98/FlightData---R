# FlightDataR

The 2009 ASA Statistical Computing and Graphics Data Expo consisted of flight arrival and departure details for all commercial flights on major carriers within the USA, from October 1987 to April 2008. 
This is a large dataset; there are nearly 120 million records in total, and takes up 1.6 gigabytes of space  compressed and 12 gigabytes when uncompressed. The complete dataset along with supplementary 
information and variable descriptions can be downloaded from the Harvard Dataverse at 
https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/HG7NV7

To run the files inside this repository, download the file 2004 and 2005, the file is to huge for me to upload here :(
